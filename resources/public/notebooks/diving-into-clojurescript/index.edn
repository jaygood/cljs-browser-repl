  programming**, remaining very **practical**, **immutability** and great
  **interoperability** with it's host language (in this case, the JS
  environment).

  "## So why is Clojurescript great?

  * Consistently designed and well thought out language.
  * Immutability is the default.
  * Programming with values.

  But it is a highly practical language:

  * Can use mutability explicitly when needed.
  * Easy interop with the ecosystem libraries of JavaScript.
